## ✨ Features

This section highlights the key workflows that deliver the most value to our users. Understanding these features will get you up and running with Neotion's core functionality quickly.

### 1. Real-time Document Collaboration

At its heart, Neotion is a collaborative tool. Create or open a document, and you can edit it in real-time with your team. Changes are synced instantly across all users, ensuring everyone is on the same page.

### 2. Document Publishing

Share your work with the world with a single click. Any document can be published to a public URL, making it easy to share notes, articles, or documentation.

### Core Workflow: From Creation to Publication

The most critical workflow in Neotion is creating, editing, and publishing a document. The diagram below visualizes this entire process, from user authentication to the final published page.

    A[User visits Neotion] --> B{Is User Authenticated?};
    B -- No --> C[Login/Sign Up via Clerk];
    C --> D[View Dashboard];
    B -- Yes --> D;
    D --> E[Create New Document];
    E -- (API Call) --> F[Convex Backend: Create Doc];
    F -- (Returns Doc ID) --> G[Redirect to Editor Page];
    G --> H["Edit Document (Tiptap Editor)"];
    H <-->|Real-time Sync| I[Convex Backend: Update Doc];
    H --> J[Click 'Publish'];
    J -- (API Call) --> K[Convex Backend: Set isPublished=true];
    K --> L[Generate Public URL];
    L --> M[Share Public Document];
```
